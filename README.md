Hi, I'm zereflaw! I am currently studying Javascript A LOT and loving it. 
Addionally, I am almost finishing my studies on Psychology at UFRJ, looking to learn anything that amuses me. 
I've set a goal to learn the most I possibily can, in such pandemic times. So, everyday i wake up and open up a different project to make on Javascript. 
All of them are silly but i believe everyone has to start with that. So, that's me starting! ^_^
